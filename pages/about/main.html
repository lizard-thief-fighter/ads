         <h2>What is Arte della Scherma?</h2>
         <p>We reconstruct martial arts from Renaissance fencing treatises.<br>
         Essentially, we fight each other with swords - but artfully, and safely.<br>
         We are woman, minority, and queer friendly, and do not tolerate bigotry.</p>
         <br><hr><br>
         <h2>Is it safe?</h2>
         <p>We use blunt trainers to simulate weapons and wear protective equipment.<br>
         This *is* a contact sport, but our first concern is with practicing safely.<br>
         We require signage of a safety waiver as an acknowledgement of risk.</p>
